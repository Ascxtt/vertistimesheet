The purpose of
this application is to help log overtime for in office employees and to track billing hours for
contractors.
Users of the application will first use a very basic login page to, login to the application
with their existing universal employee credentials. After a successful login the user will be
presented with a time sheet form. This form will capture the work title (a title given to the task
that was to be completed), the client for whom the task was completed and a dynamic list of
dates, start and end times and comments for each period spent on the job in question. The
application should also calculate and display, the total time spent for each period, as soon as the
user has finished entering the time.
Other information that should appear on the page, for verification purposes, but should
already be stored and therefore not need to be filled out by the user is, the user’s name and
address and, when the client is selected from an existing list of clients the corresponding
manager’s name and position should also be displayed on the page.
After filling out the required information, users should then be able to submit the sheet
and receive confirmation of submission.
